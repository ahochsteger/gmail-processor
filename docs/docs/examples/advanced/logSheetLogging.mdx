This example demonstrates the advanced logging possibilities to a Google Spreadsheet.

The following `settings` are used to configure the logging behafior:
* `logSheetLocation`: The location of the spreadsheet document to be logged into.
* `logFields`: The list of log fields which are used to log into a separate column in the given order.
* `logSheetTracing`: Logs additional tracing logs into the log sheet.

The action `global.sheetLog` is then used to log certain messages into the logsheet at the given `processingStage`s.
