## How do I test my configuration without risking unwanted changes to Gmail or GDrive?

Use the `dry-run` mode:

```javascript
function run() {
  // NOTE: Switch to "safe-mode" after testing the config
  GmailProcessorLib.run(config, "dry-run")
}
```

## How do I migrate my configuration from GMail2GDrive to Gmail Processor?

Use the [playground](/playground). See [Migrating from GMail2GDrive](migrating.md) for details.

## How do I use my own customized version of the Gmail Processor library?

See [Getting Started - Copy the Library Code](getting-started.md#copy-the-library-code-advanced).

## How do I use multiple configurations within a single Google Apps Script project?

Make sure to give all variables and functions unique names since they all share the same namespace - even if located in different `*.gs` files:

```javascript
var config1 = {...}
function run1() {
  GmailProcessorLib.run(config1, ...)
}

var config2 = {...}
function run2() {
  GmailProcessorLib.run(config2, ...)
}
```
