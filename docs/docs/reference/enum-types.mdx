The method to mark processed threads/messages/attachments.

| Key | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `ADD_THREAD_LABEL` | `add-label` | Adds the label defined in the setting `markProcessedLabel` to each processed thread.<br /><br />**NOTE:**<br />- Automatically appends the action `thread.addLabel` to the list of global thread actions<br />- Automatically appends `-label:<markProcessedLabel>` to the global thread match query config<br /><br />**Limitations:**<br />- It cannot handle multiple messages per thread properly. |
| `CUSTOM` | `custom` | Doesn't do anything to mark threads, messages or attachments as processed and leaves this task to the user.<br /><br />**NOTE:**<br />- Use actions on the desired level (threads, messages or attachments) to mark them as processed.<br />- Take care to exclude them from queries in the thread match config, to prevent re-processing over and over again.<br /><br />**Limitations:**<br />- Is more complex since you have to take care to |
| `MARK_MESSAGE_READ` | `mark-read` | Marks processed messages as read, which is more flexible than adding a thread label.<br />But it comes at the cost of marking messages as read, which may not be expected.<br /><br />**NOTE:**<br />- Automatically appends the action `message.markRead` to the list of global message actions<br />- Automatically appends `-is:read` to the global thread match query config<br />- Automatically adds `is: ["unread"]` to the global message match config<br /><br />**Limitations:**<br />- Since it marks messages as read it may not be applicable in all cases. |
