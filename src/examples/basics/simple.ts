/**
 * This is a simple example to start with Gmail Processor.
 *
 * There's one **critical decision** to be taken about how threads or messages should be marked as processed to prevent multiple processing.
 * * **`mark-read`:** Mark processed messages as read. This is the recommended method to get started, because it also can deal with multiple messages per thread.
 *   - PROS: Can process additional messages within the same thread even after a thread has already been processed.
 *   - CONS: Marks the processed messages as read, which may not be what you want to have.
 * * **`add-label`:** Mark processed threads by attaching the label configured using `markProcessedLabel`. This is recommended for simple cases with just a single message in each processed thread.
 *   - PROS: Keeps processed messages in an unread state.
 *   - CONS: Cannot process additional messages that may be added after a thread has already been processed.
 * * **`custom`:**: Leaves the decision on how to remember processed threads/messages to the user of the library using certain actions.
 *   - PROS: Most flexible, can deal with many edge cases using one of the many actions (e.g. `moveToArchive`, `moveToTrash`, `star`, `markRead`, `markImportant`, `addLabel`)
 *   - CONS: Great care has to be taken that the matching configuration and the actions to mark entities as processed fit together. Otherwise they may get processed over and over again.
 *
 * You can put match configs which should m
 * The primary configuration resides in a nested list of config structures with the following parts:
 * * `threads`:
 *   * Defines which threads should be queried and matched in the `match` section.
 *   * Defines which actions should be executed for matching threads in the `actions` section.
 *   * Delegates processing of further messages to the `messages` section.
 * * `messages`:
 *   * Defines which messages should be matched in the `match` section.
 *   * Defines which actions should be executed for matching messages in the `actions` section.
 *   * Delegates processing of further attachments to the `attachments` section.
 * * `attachments`:
 *   * Defines which attachments should be matched in the `match` section.
 *   * Defines which actions should be executed for matching attachments in the `actions` section.
 *
 * Matches or actions that should always be taken into account for every thread/message/attachment can be put into the global section.
 *
 * This example uses a global thread match query to ensure only threads that comply to these criteria should be processed:
 * * has attachments
 * * is not in trash
 * * is not in spam
 * * is not a draft
 * * contains messages after a certain date
 * * contains messages with a certain subject
 *
 * The processing continues by restricting the query to threads where the user is the sender.
 * Since the messages section does not have any additional matcher, all messages in the thread will be processed.
 * In the attachments section the `match` section restricts processing to attachments that have the name `invoice.pdf` using a regular expression.
 * Matching attachments will then be stored at the given location using [placeholder substitution](https://ahochsteger.github.io/gmail-processor/docs/reference/placeholder) to dynamically create the location based on thread/message/attachment data.
